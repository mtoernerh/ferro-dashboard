FERRO is an interdisciplinary project that seeks to foster circularly based management of eutrophication. 
It integrates a wide array of fields: hydrobiology, remote sensing, biotechnology, engineering and agriculture to facilitate lake restoration efforts in Europe.
FERRO will provide the research and conservation community with new tools and methodologies for lake nutrient recovery and reuse in agriculture, 
as well as help in the identification and prioritisation of lakes for restoration.
